                            Our goal is to enable scientists, researchers,
                            health professionals, and other subject matter
                            experts to bring their insights and analysis over
                            breaking news and scientific reports in a way that
                            informs the public discourse with the general public
                            via annotations. Annotations are short responses to
                            evidence or fact based claims made within both
                            popular media and/or social media. Through short
                            responses, or "annotations," over web-based media,
                            the Viral Feedback team is working to enable
                            scientific experts in their respective fields to
                            provide high quality, data-driven, non-partisan
                            analysis of COVID-19-related topics within the news

                            source platform developed by Hypothesis that allows
                            for these annotations to be layered over a wide
                            range of publications, including news reports,
                            government actions, breaking scientific papers (ie.
                            preprints), and other media.

                            because they can 1) mark up source material without
                            the need for integration (or permission), 2)
                            precisely target specific claims, and 3) concentrate
                            knowledgeable voices from within a community.
